## 📦 What is Mimestream?

Mimestream is a modern and efficient email client for macOS that’s purpose-built for Gmail. Unlike traditional email clients, Mimestream uses the Gmail API directly (instead of IMAP), providing a fast, responsive, and fully integrated Gmail experience while maintaining the elegance and speed of a native macOS app.

With support for multiple accounts, custom Gmail labels, category tabs (like Primary, Social, Promotions), and Gmail's powerful search, Mimestream brings all the Gmail features you love into a beautiful and seamless macOS interface. It also supports offline use, smart notifications, and email aliases, making it a professional-grade option for power users.

Its native Swift-based design means it's fast, energy efficient, and looks great on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Whether you're a casual user or rely on Gmail for work, Mimestream is designed to help you stay productive with minimal distractions and maximum control.
